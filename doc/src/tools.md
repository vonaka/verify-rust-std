# Verification Tools

The verification tool ecosystem for Rust is rapidly growing, and we welcome the usage of different tools to solve our challenges.
In this chapter, you can find a list of tools that have already been approved for new solutions,
what is their CI current status, as well as more details on how to use them.

If you would like to add a new tool to the list of tool applications,
please see the [Tool Application](general-rules.md#tool-applications) section.
